This is a homework what we have done throughout a whole year. It is written in a combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The website combines the functionalities of a to-do list, a budget app, and a Pomodoro timer. You can get directly a preview of our website at https://jackie6238.github.io/https-Jackie6238.github.io/.

This is a short descriptive video about the whole experience and a brief demonstration of our website.

Timer

Do you want to concentrate on your work? The best way is to organize your time better and to alternate between work and rest. Try this section and you will do better!

Once on the "Timer" page, the default setting is in work mode and you have a 25 minute timer in front of you. You can adjust it between 1 and 60 minutes at the bottom right of the page according to your convenience. Once adjusted, you start the timer by clicking "start". You can also take a temporary break and restart your timer using the other two buttons at the bottom of the timer.

When you want, you can switch to rest mode whenever you want. You have a timer that works on the same principle. You can adjust it between 1 and 30 minutes using the setting at the bottom left of the page.



Task
This page also gives you the opportunity to list your to-do list and your desires while adding value to them.

Once on the task page, you can add your to-dos and their value at the bottom of the page. You have the option to edit a task or delete it by clicking on the pencil or trash can buttons. Once the task is complete, you can check on the task done. It disappears from this section and the value is added to the scale.

The "wishes" section is used to add your wishes and their value. It works on the same principle as the list of your tasks, except that when you check your wish, it is the subtraction of the value which is made at the scale.
Vous pouvez aussi faire un aperçu de l’ensemble vos tâches et de vos désirs en cliquant « all ». Cette section vous montre tous les éléments que vous avez ajoutés, et la liste contient aussi les tâches et les désirs que vous avez terminés qui sont barrés. Vous pouvez modifier ou supprimer tous les éléments dans cette section.

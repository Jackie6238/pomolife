# Homework Project - ToDo List, Budget App, and Pomodoro Timer Website

This comprehensive homework project was developed in 2021 by Yiyun, Haozhang, and Jackie in Grade 11, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website combines the functionalities of a to-do list, a budget app, and a Pomodoro timer. The website is available here for demo purposes: https://jackie6238.github.io/pomolife/ 

## Timer

Want to improve your work concentration? Organize your time effectively with the Timer section, which allows you to alternate between work and rest.

- By default, the timer is set to 25 minutes in work mode.
- You can adjust the timer between 1 and 60 minutes at the bottom right of the page.
- Start the timer by clicking "start."
- Take a temporary break and restart your timer using the buttons at the bottom of the timer.

You can also switch to rest mode whenever you want, with a timer working on the same principle. Adjust it between 1 and 30 minutes using the setting at the bottom left of the page.

## Task

The Task page lets you list your to-do tasks and desires while assigning values to them.

- Add your to-do tasks and their values at the bottom of the page.
- Edit or delete a task using the pencil or trash can buttons.
- Mark tasks as complete, and the value will be added to the scale.

In the "Wishes" section, follow a similar process, where checking a wish subtracts its value from the scale.

You can also get an overview of all your tasks and desires by clicking "all." This section displays all items, including completed tasks and wishes, which are crossed out. You have the option to modify or delete items in this section.
